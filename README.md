# Deepcut CLI

This is the frontend for Deepcut, a dynamic web app built specifically for producers and beatmakers that are often looking for samples online. The app helps users discover lesser-known music ("deep cuts") randomly served by the [Deepcut API (Backend)](https://github.com/samyAlliche/deepcut). The API is connected to a database filled with youtube curated playlists.

**Live Demo:** https://deepcut.twxntytwo.com
